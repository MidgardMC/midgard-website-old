            <h2>COMMUNITY CONDUCT</h2>
            <p>Our server language is English. All public chat, including in game and on Mumble are English only.</p>
            <p> Don’t use all caps in chat (YELLING), repeat questions or spam.</p>
            <p> Please keep all activities on our server family friendly. We cater to mature, seasoned players, but
                children often watch. This includes language in chat, player skins and builds. Please be respectful to
                players and staff. No swearing, hate speech, religion or politics discussions in open chat.</p>

            <p>Please do not circumvent the AFK timer, especially for player material gain. This counts as cheating.</p>
            <p>Do not impersonate or mock staff or other users in any way. This is grounds for a permanent ban.</p>
            <p>You can post links to screenshots and on-topic family friendly web pages in server chat. However, we ask
                that you not spam chat with links constantly as it can be disruptive.</p>
            <p>Please do not advertise other Minecraft servers here. “Poaching” users from any community is considered
                to be extremely disrespectful and we take this seriously.</p>

            <p>This server has an in-game currency system. It is forbidden to charge other players actual real life
                money for anything in-game. This is not the place to advertise the sale of Minecraft accounts and goods
                or services outside of game.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="streaming">
            <h2>STREAMING</h2>
            <p>Yes! You may stream your activities here on Twitch and similar networks. We love the positive feedback
                this can bring. We only ask that you keep the address to the server off of stream to prevent
                attacks.</p>
            <p>If someone in game is streaming, by all means watch their stream and participate on their chat. But
                please do not follow them around and crowd them in game without their permission. Also, if a streamer is
                online, we kindly ask not to post web links in server chat.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="worlds">
            <h2>WORLDS</h2>
            <p>All worlds are set on Normal difficulty unless otherwise specified.</p>
            <p>Midgard: The main survival world. This is the place for you to build your home/base on. This world is set
                on Normal difficulty. We do not reset this world* Size is a nice big 14,000 blocks squared.</p>
            <p>Resource: Resource world. This world resets every 90 days or so, or when it is determined necessary.
                Please don’t build on this world or store items there as it can be reset without notice. Short term
                storage at resource spawn is provided. There is also a public use shelter if you wish to sleep through a
                night on resource.</p>
            <p>Flatland: This is a creative flat world that you can use for prototyping or experimentation on.</p>
            <p>* We only reset the main world due to changes in Minecraft’s biomes or terrain generation. Players will
                be notified if the survival map requires a reset well in advance, and options for transferring builds
                and/or items will be considered. We will work with you.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="griefing">
            <h2>GRIEFING</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for all activity that originates from your Minecraft account. “My friend/family
                member borrowed my computer, etc” is not a valid excuse. Secure your stuff!</p>

            <p>We pride ourselves on having a place that is safe and comfortable to play. If you did not build it or
                have explicit permission to touch it, don’t mess with it!</p>
            <p>If you do suspect any griefing or damage, Please note the exact location where you found the issue and
                notify an admin either in private chat or in a mail message on the server.</p>
            <p>Don’t build or lure players into traps intended to kill. 1x1 holes to bedrock, even on resource, will be
                investigated if found. (It is OK to dig down to go mining, but please keep others’ safety in mind.)</p>
            <p>Lag machines are not tolerated. Please keep your hopper/sorter count and size in check. Also please set
                up larger redstone machines with a switch to turn them off when you aren’t using them.</p>
            <p>TNT use is prohibited. Likewise, fire placement is enabled but spread is disabled. Please build as if
                fire spread might be enabled sometime in the future. There is no telling what future versions of the
                game may change.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="protection">
            <h2>PROTECTION</h2>
            <p>Doors, chests, furnaces, brewing stands, and other containers can be locked using /lock. See /lwc for a
                full list of options.</p>
            <p>Please be reasonable about claiming land. DO NOT claim land if you don’t plan to build on it. Please do
                not make multiple claims and leave abandoned builds around. We may remove or store builds that are
                determined abandoned. Region protection is to secure your builds, not empty land.</p>
            <p>If you require larger region protection than is available to you, please ask any admin for help.</p>
            <p>A lack of protection does not mean you can break, steal, or otherwise mess with a build.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="mining">
            <h2>MINING</h2>
            <p>Use the Resource world for chopping trees and mining lots of materials.</p>
            <p>Trees should only be chopped down on Survival if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are not on or near somebody else's property or public roads.</li>
                <li>They are fully chopped down. Please do not leave “floating trees”.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The outer landscape is left in good or improved condition.</p>
            <p>You may mine underground on the Midgard main world as long as it is within your property borders.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="building">
            <h2>BUILDING</h2>
            <p>Be conscious of how your build might affect another player’s existing build or disrupt the landscape of
                the area. Please leave plenty of room between you and your neighbor unless you’re working together.</p>
            <p>There are towns and developments that are managed by players. If you wish to build or obtain a home in
                these, please ask the person responsible before changing anything. You may also start your own town or
                development as long as there is plenty of land available. Please post a sign on your community.</p>
            <p>Any bridge that crosses water should be at least two blocks high to allow boats to cross underneath.</p>
            <p>Disruptive, abandoned incomplete or offensive builds may be relocated by staff without warning.</p>
            <p>We understand that your first days on the server require a really basic shelter. Please remove any
                temporary shelters as soon as possible once you have your home built..</p>
            <p>Please pick appropriate land for your build. There is no reason to have to “shoe-horn” your house between
                others here on such a big map. Please don’t build right against roads. There should be at least 12-15
                blocks of space between the road and your build. Cities and developments can have exceptions. Also, try
                to center your connection roads and walkways between lamps on the road.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="farms">
            <h2>FARMS</h2>
            <p>There is a public farm west of spawn called the Seed and Feed. You are welcome to harvest as long as you
                replant.</p>
            <p>Please replant any trees you cut down in public tree farms.</p>
            <p>Don’t use private farms unless you have permission from the owner.</p>
            <p>Please keep mob farms to a reasonable limit of 100 entities.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="bans">
            <h2>BANS</h2>
            <p>We pride ourselves in having a history where very few players have ever been banned.
                For a very minor infraction, you may be removed from the whitelist for a determined period as decided by
                staff. Major infractions will result in permanent removal from our community. Very major infractions
                (cheating and obvious heavy greifing) will result in a major ban and other communities be alerted.
                Any attack on the server (DDOS , etc) will be investigated and the authorities may be contacted.

        <section id="dot">
            <h2>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</h2>
            <p>Midgard has a system of roads, tunnels, bridges, viaducts, railroads and other means of transport
                including nether portals and roads. Please do not alter any road, bridge, tunnel, viaduct or railroad
                without approval of staff. If you wish to intersect with a road, please let us know. Likewise, this
                server provides roads as a service, so if you need a road or extension built to reach your land, also
                let us know and we will build and/or assist. DOT has materials for road building if you require them.
                Just ask any staff member. If you find damage to a road, bridge or tunnel, please let an admin know and
                include the DOT ID number if available. These signs are usually placed out of normal view but easy to
                get to along the side or underneath bridges and at tunnel exits.</p>

            <h2>DONATIONS</h2>
            <p>Midgard offers all of its services for free of charge. We do not solicit payments and do not have any
                sort of paid user enhanced levels. If you wish to donate, please ask any staff member. Any and all
                donations will be put towards hardware maintenance and upgrade costs and/or the operating costs of the
                web server. Anyone who donates will have their name added to the donation board at spawn. Donations are
                appreciated but are absolutely not required.</p>

            <h2>ACCESS</h2>
            <p>Midgard is a whitelist only server. Your access must be pre-approved and granted by staff.</p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on our history of offering a safe, fun place for our community to play. If you must be
                away for an extended period, because frankly, real life takes priority over any game, just let us know.
                Your build and possessions will remain safe and untouched until you can return. We also put effort into
                making sure the server is reliable and available for you any time you wish to play or use the Mumble
                server.</p>
            <p>We operate 24/7/365 and we are proud of our high uptime and reliability. Please follow us on Twitter
                (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?&screen_name=midgardmc">@midgardmc</a>) and check there for
                any downtime announcements as sometimes these are necessary to keep
                things up to date and running smoothly.</p>
